OPERATION: ${operationName}

SITUATION AND MISSION:
*The Area of Operations is ${areaOfOperations}. The primary enemy forces are ${enemyForces}. The section below framed by [] contains the key locations the team needs to address (each separated by a comma). Generate a single, cohesive storyline describing the situation the team needs to handle based on the objectives you will generate for these locations. Be creative but use realistic military objectives. Ensure objectives are varied and richly detailed. Do not write separate paragraphs for each location. Make sure the section framed by [] is NOT included in your output.
[${locationsString}]
*

CONCEPT OF OPERATION:
*Generate a short paragraph describing how the team will leave HQ via helicopter and land in the AO, then we will move on with our objectives.*

OBJECTIVES:
*Generate a list of objectives based on the SITUATION AND MISSION paragraph you generated above. Each objective should be marked with a letter like Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc., and be one very brief sentence. There should be exactly ${selectedLocations.length} objectives listed, one for each location.*

*Generate a list at the bottom of the operation named "HVTs possibly present in the AO:" containing a few HVT profiles to act as secondary objectives.
